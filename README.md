This is the repository for the embedded watch source for Bluetooth 2.1 and 4.0 for models WDS111 (Au1000) as main devolpment project. This tree is designed for TI Code Composer Studio (CCS) and IAR Embedded WorkbenchÂ® for TI MSP430. This project has all the modules of the firmware including GUI, Bluetooth stack, background threads, and remote protocol handler. Different branches may be used for more divergent projects. TI's Code Composer firmware IDE is supported in this same firmware repository as the IAR version. The CCS IDE is available for FREE to all Meta Watch users that purchased a WDS11x development system or a development clip for STRATA or FRAME. Until there is a special download site, just get the 30 evaluation version and email ccs@metawatch.org when you need your license upgraded.

Please only use for analog watch development. In order to develop the digital watch systems (WDS112, SW12) visit: https://github.com/MetaWatchOpenProjects/MetaWatch-Gen2
